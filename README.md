# Sunflower-Bot

**This branch is currently configured to run on Repl.it**

If you want to run in a local machine or another host, it's probably the best to remove the lines and files.
*Those being: **'host.js'** **'.replit'** as well as lines 7 and 25 on **'core.js'***

As no one uses this repo as a base, i won't bother creating a branch without the hosting contents, but if you want to, let me know ;)


# .json Packages

Both **'package.json'** and **'package-lock.json'** have my personal information, so you should probably delete those and run 'npm init'
'npm install [package]' for every package. Just remember to credit me :)
